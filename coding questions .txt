Here are some coding questions related to CRUD operations using JPA and Hibernate:

Question 1: Entity Definition

Define a JPA entity class named Employee with the following attributes:

id: Long (Primary Key)
name: String
age: int
salary: double
Question 2: Repository Interface

Create a Spring Data JPA repository interface for the Employee entity named EmployeeRepository.

Question 3: Service Method

Implement a service method named updateEmployeeName in the EmployeeService class. This method should take two parameters: employeeId (Long) and newName (String), and update the name of the employee with the given ID.

Question 4: Controller Endpoint

Develop a controller endpoint to retrieve all employees sorted by their salary in descending order. The endpoint should return a JSON array of Employee objects.

Question 5: Unit Test

Write a unit test for the createEmployee method in the EmployeeService class. Ensure that the method properly saves a new employee to the database.

These questions aim to test various aspects of CRUD operations using JPA and Hibernate, including entity definition, repository usage, service layer logic, controller endpoints, and unit testing.
